# Delivery Route Optimization (A* Algorithm

Overview

The Delivery Route Optimization project is a Python-based GUI application that helps find the optimal delivery route between locations using the A (A-Star) algorithm*. It calculates the shortest path between locations and displays the best route along with the total distance.

Features

Add Routes: Users can input routes between locations along with distances.

Graph Visualization: Displays the entered routes dynamically in text format.

A Algorithm Implementation:* Finds the shortest delivery route based on the given locations.

User-Friendly GUI: Built using Tkinter, making it easy to interact with.
